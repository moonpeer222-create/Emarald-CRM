# System Health & Sync Verification Report

## 1. System Integrity Check
- **Codebase**: Verified all key files (`App.tsx`, `RootLayout.tsx`, `routes.tsx`) are present and correctly configured.
- **Routing**: React Router Data mode is correctly implemented in `routes.tsx` with protected guards for Admin, Agent, and Customer portals.
- **Dependencies**: All required packages (`supabase-js`, `motion`, `react-router`, `lucide-react`) are installed.

## 2. Branding Verification
- **Colors**: All "emerald" color classes have been replaced with `blue`, `indigo`, `cyan`, and `teal` variants across the UI.
- **Text**: "Universal CRM" text remains in the UI as requested.
- **Data Keys**: `emerald-` prefixes are preserved in `localStorage` keys, API endpoints, and filenames to maintain data compatibility.
- **Admin Header**: `AdminHeader.tsx` was freshly read and confirms the use of the new color scheme while keeping the "Living Emerald Brand" concept (Gem animation) using compatible colors.

## 3. Sync & Offline Architecture
- **Primary Sync System**: `SyncProvider.tsx` + `syncService.ts` is the active sync engine.
  - It connects to the Supabase Edge Function (`/make-server-5cdc87b7`).
  - It supports offline-first writes (optimistic UI) and background syncing.
  - It handles bulk syncs for Cases, Agents, Notifications, and more.
- **Conflict Prevention**: 
  - `CloudSyncService` (older/alternate implementation) is **dormant** in the main layout, preventing double-sync issues.
  - `DataSync` (in `dataSync.ts`) runs purely local integrity checks (deduplication, fixers) and does not conflict with network sync.
- **Emergency Fixes**: `EmergencyDataFix` is active and automatically repairs corrupted notification data (object-to-array conversion) on app start.

## 4. Backend Integration
- **Server**: Supabase Edge Function (`index.tsx`) is correctly set up with CORS, Key-Value storage, and endpoints for all entities.
- **API**: `api.ts` is correctly configured with the project ID and anonymous key.

## Status: ✅ LIVE & WORKING
The application is ready. The sync system is robust, branding is updated, and data integrity safeguards are in place.
