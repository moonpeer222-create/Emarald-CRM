## 🎨 **Figma AI Prompt: Unified CRM Template - Mobile-First Optimized**

```markdown
ACT AS: Senior Product Designer & Design System Architect.

TASK: Consolidate ALL Universal CRM portals (Admin, Agent, Operator, Customer) into a SINGLE, UNIFIED template without repetition, overlapping, or confusion. MOBILE-FIRST OPTIMIZED - design for phone first, then scale to tablet/desktop. Make it developer and user-friendly with clear structure, consistent components, and organized navigation.

CURRENT PROBLEM TO SOLVE:
❌ Multiple templates causing confusion
❌ Repeating elements across portals
❌ Overlapping features between roles
❌ Hard for developer to check/maintain
❌ Inconsistent UI patterns
❌ Not optimized for mobile (Pakistan agents use phones primarily)

GOAL:
✅ ONE master template for all roles (Mobile-First)
✅ Zero repetition (reuse components)
✅ Clear role-based visibility (show/hide, not duplicate)
✅ Developer-friendly structure (organized layers, naming)
✅ Consistent UI patterns across all portals
✅ Phone-first optimization (320px - 390px base)

## 🏗️ UNIFIED DESIGN SYSTEM STRUCTURE (Mobile-First)

### 1. 📐 SINGLE COMPONENT LIBRARY (No Duplicates):
Create ONE master component page with mobile-first variants:
```
📦 Components/
  ├── 🎨 Atoms (Buttons, Inputs, Badges, Icons) - Mobile sizes first
  ├── 🧩 Molecules (Cards, Form Fields, Search Bars) - Stack vertically
  ├── 🏠 Organisms (Headers, Sidebars, Tables, Dashboards) - Mobile nav first
  └── 📄 Templates (Page Layouts for all roles) - 390px base width
```
**Rules:**
- Each component = ONE source of truth (no variants per role)
- Role-based visibility controlled by props/conditions (e.g., `showForRole: ['admin', 'operator']`)
- All components use same design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- **Mobile-first:** Design for 390px first, then add tablet (768px) + desktop (1440px) breakpoints

### 2. 🎨 UNIFIED COLOR & TYPOGRAPHY TOKENS:
```
Colors (Single Source):
Take inspiration from the Admin portal
- Status: 🟢 Success #10B981 | 🟡 Warning #F59E0B | 🔴 Error #EF4444

Typography (Single Scale - Mobile Readable):
- Headings: Inter Bold (20px mobile, 24px tablet, 28px desktop)
- Body: Inter Regular (16px mobile minimum, 14px secondary)
- Urdu: Jameel Noori Nastaleeq (same sizes, RTL support)
- Touch Targets: Minimum 48px height for all interactive elements
```
**No role-specific colors or fonts.**

### 3. 🧭 SINGLE NAVIGATION STRUCTURE (Mobile-First + Role-Based):
```
📍 Mobile Navigation (Bottom Tab Bar - 390px):
├── 📊 Dashboard (All roles see, content varies by role)
├── 📁 Cases (All roles see, data filtered by role)
├── ➕ Quick Actions (Contextual based on role)
├── 🔔 Notifications (All roles, badge count varies)
├── 👤 Profile (All roles, settings vary by role)

📍 Tablet/Desktop Navigation (Sidebar - 768px+):
├── 📊 Dashboard
├── 📁 Cases
├── 📅 Appointments (Operator + Admin only)
├── 💰 Payments (Agent + Admin + Operator)
├── 👥 Attendance (Operator + Admin only)
├── 📈 Reports (Admin only)
├── ⚙️ Settings (Admin only)
└── 🎛️ Operations (Operator + Admin only)
```
**Implementation:**
- Same navigation component for ALL roles
- Mobile: Bottom tab bar (5 max items, thumb-friendly)
- Desktop: Sidebar (expandable, all menu items)
- Hide/show menu items based on user role (not separate navs)
- Consistent icons + labels across all portals

### 4. 📄 UNIFIED PAGE TEMPLATES (Mobile-First, No Duplicates):
Create ONE template per page type, mobile-first:

```
📄 Template: Dashboard (Mobile 390px First)
  ├── Header (Logo + Notification Bell + Profile - stacked on mobile)
  ├── Stats Cards (2-column grid on mobile, 4-column on desktop)
  ├── Widgets (Stack vertically on mobile, grid on desktop)
  └── Bottom Nav (Fixed, thumb zone optimized)

📄 Template: Case Detail (Mobile-First)
  ├── Header (Back button + Case ID + Status Badge)
  ├── Timeline (Vertical stepper on mobile, horizontal on desktop)
  ├── Tabs (Scrollable horizontal tabs on mobile)
  └── Action Buttons (Fixed bottom bar on mobile, inline on desktop)

📄 Template: List View (Mobile-First)
  ├── Search Bar (Full-width, sticky on mobile)
  ├── Filters (Collapsible drawer on mobile, sidebar on desktop)
  ├── Cards (Full-width cards on mobile, table on desktop)
  └── Pagination (Load More button on mobile, page numbers on desktop)
```
**Rule:** If 2 roles see similar page → Use SAME template, control visibility via permissions.

### 5. 🔐 ROLE-BASED PERMISSION LAYER (Visual Indicators):
Instead of separate portals, use permission badges:
```
[👁️ View Only] → For roles that can see but not edit
[✏️ Editable] → For roles that can modify
[🔒 Locked] → For roles that cannot access
[⚠️ Requires Approval] → For actions needing Admin confirmation
```
**Example:**
- Payment Record Button (Mobile):
  - Agent: Full-width button "Submit (Pending Approval)" ⚠️
  - Operator: Full-width button "Record (Pending Admin)" ⚠️
  - Admin: Full-width button "Approve/Reject" ✅

### 6. 🗂️ ORGANIZED FIGMA FILE STRUCTURE:

## 🎨 DESIGN RULES (Enforce Consistency - Mobile-First):

### Spacing:
```
- Use 8px grid system throughout (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
- Mobile padding: 16px sides, 24px top/bottom
- Tablet padding: 24px sides, 32px top/bottom
- Desktop padding: 32px sides, 48px top/bottom
- No manual spacing values (use auto-layout spacing tokens)
```

### Colors:
```
- Use color tokens only (no hex codes directly on elements)
- Status colors consistent (🟢 Success, 🟡 Warning, 🔴 Error everywhere)
- High contrast for mobile outdoor visibility (Pakistan sunlight)
```

### Typography:
```
- Use text styles only (no manual font sizes/weights)
- Mobile minimum: 16px body text (readable on small screens)
- Urdu/English toggle uses same text styles (just different font family)
- Line height: 1.5x for mobile readability
```

### Components:
```
- Master component → All instances linked (no detached elements)
- Variants for states (Default, Hover, Disabled, Error, Loading)
- Variants for breakpoints (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop)
- No "similar" components (if 90% same → merge into one)
```

### Icons:
```
- Single icon library (Lucide React)
- Mobile: 24px minimum (touch-friendly)
- Desktop: 20px standard
- No custom icons unless absolutely necessary
```

□ Remove hidden layers (delete unused, don't hide)
□ Label all frames with clear naming convention
□ Add annotations for role-based visibility conditions
□ Document all API endpoints on relevant components
□ Create permissions matrix in Notes section
□ Add version number + change log on Cover Page
□ Test all prototype flows (ensure no broken links)
□ Export component usage report (identify unused duplicates)
□ Verify all touch targets are 48px minimum (mobile)
□ Test mobile layouts at 320px, 375px, 390px widths
□ Verify text is readable at 16px minimum on mobile
□ Check color contrast for outdoor visibility (WCAG AA)
□ Document responsive breakpoints clearly
```
