   - RTL layout support: Proper text alignment, icon positioning, navigation flow
   - Font fallback chain: Jameel Noori Nastaleeq → Noto Nastaliq Urdu → system serif

3. **Thumb Zone Optimization:**
   - Critical actions (Submit, Save, Call) positioned in bottom 1/3 of mobile screen
   - Secondary actions (Edit, Share, More) in middle third
   - Destructive actions (Delete, Reject) require confirmation or positioned top

4. **Offline-Resilient Architecture:**

   - Local storage: Cache case data, form inputs, user preferences
   - Conflict resolution: Last-write-wins with audit log for manual review

5. **Error Prevention & Recovery:**

   - Auto-save drafts: Every 30 seconds + manual save button
   - Undo functionality: Toast with "Undo" link for recent actions (5-second window)

## 🚫 DESIGN AVOIDANCES

- ❌ Overly complex multi-step forms → Break into wizard with progress indicator
- ❌ Dense tables on mobile → Use card layout with expandable rows, horizontal scroll only when necessary
- ❌ Generic stock icons → Use custom visa/recruitment icon set (passport, visa stamp, airplane, medical cross)
- ❌ Assume high-speed internet → Optimize images (WebP fallback), lazy load, show loading skeletons
- ❌ Hidden navigation → Keep primary actions visible or one tap away, avoid hamburger menus on mobile
- ❌ Unclear error states → Show specific, actionable error messages with recovery suggestions
- ❌ Inconsistent spacing → Strict 8px grid system, use auto-layout for responsive spacing
